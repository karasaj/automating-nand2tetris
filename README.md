# Automating Nand2Tetris #

Nand2Tetris is an open source computer architecture course that aims to teach students and interested individuals topics in Computer 
Architecture. The project aims to illustrate this by starting with the basic elements of Computer design - hardware description 
languages, and then proceeding up to assembly language as well as high level language constructs.

This project repository provides an automated testing script that can test any of the projects under Nand2Tetris. The 
goal is to make testing your Nand2Tetris files easier to test. 

## Installation ##

The test script uses Python 3.5.x and Java to run the Nand2Tetris Suite. You can get Python 3.5.x [here](https://www.python.org/), and Java [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 

## Support ##

Both Python and Java have wide support across Windows, OSX, and Linux, and this program automatically detects your OS to use batch or shell files. It will work for Windows, OSX, and Linux.
